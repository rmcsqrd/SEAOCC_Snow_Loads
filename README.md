This repository is used for massaging the original .kmz files into a more useable form within leaflet.

The python scripts are used to clean existing JSON data and vestigal artifacts from the google earth migration.

<strong> Usage </strong>

 - place file within `support/original_kmz/` that you want to parse stuff out of
 - run the script
 - pull data from `support/data/` and paste where you want (`/snowloads/data/` if you're working with the snowloads website hugo build)
